k(ssh) centos64 /root/pacman -h\An Arch's pacman-liked package manager for all Linux distributions.
Instead of remembering various options/tools on different OSs, the tool
provide common way to manipulate packages. Not all options of the native
package manager are ported; the tool only provides very basic interface to
search, install, remove packages and/or update the system.

Arch's pacman is chosen, as pacman has a quite smart when it devices all
packages-related operatios into three major groups: Synchronize, Query
and Removing/Clean up. It has a clean man page, and it is the only tool
needed to manipulate official packages. (Debian, for example, requires
you to use apt-get, dpkg and/or aptitude.)

The tool supports the following types of package manager:

  pacman        by Arch Linux, ArchBang
  dpkg/apt-get  by Debian, Ubuntu
  yum/rpm       by Redhat, CentOS, Fedora Core

Syntax
  $0 <operation> <option(s)> <packages>

Operations

    -Q              list all installed packages
    -Ql <package>   list package's files
    -Qi <package>   print package status

                      http://dragula.org/blogs/646
Options
    -f              force yes
    -v              be verbose
    -w              download packages but donot install them

Notes

  To install a package from backports repository on Debian system:
      pacman -S foobar -t lenny-backports

  Similiarily, any further option isn't recognized by getopts (1) can be
  passed to system tool.

  When being executed on Arch-liked system, the tool simplify invokes
  the system tool '/usr/bin/pacman'. So you would never install this tool
  as '/usr/bin/pacman', otherwise you may break the your system!
